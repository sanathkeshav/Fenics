FreeFEM++ is great tool to solve medium sized problems using the Finite Element Method. FreeFEM++ provides the user with a variety of Finite Elements ref.\cite{1205.1293} to choose from, depending on the nature of the problem, although the discussion was limited to only \textbf{conforming finite elements} ref.\cite{FEM} in this report. \\

\noindent
FreeFEM++ allows the user to input the parameters - from declaring the finite element space to the weak form of the problem, in a way that closely resembles the mathematical formulation of the same. This provides more control on what problems that the user needs to solve, which can be done just by changing the weak formulation accordingly in the software. Also FreeFEM++ has \textbf{mpi} (Message Passing Interface) implemented in it, which provides a wide scope for parallelization.\\
